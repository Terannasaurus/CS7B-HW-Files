A Calabi–Yau manifold, also known as a Calabi–Yau space, is a special type of manifold that is described in certain branches of
mathematics such as algebraic geometry. The Calabi–Yau manifold's properties, such as Ricci flatness, also yield applications in
theoretical physics. Particularly in superstring theory, the extra dimensions of spacetime are sometimes conjectured to take the
form of a 6-dimensional Calabi–Yau manifold, which led to the idea of mirror symmetry. Calabi–Yau manifolds are complex manifolds
that are generalizations of K3 surfaces in any number of complex dimensions (i.e. any even number of real dimensions). They were
originally defined as compact Kähler manifolds with a vanishing first Chern class anda Ricci-flat metric, though many other
similar but inequivalent definitions are sometimes used. They were named "Calabi–Yauspaces" by Candelas et al. (1985) after
Eugenio Calabi (1954, 1957) who first conjectured that such surfaces might exist, and Shing-Tung Yau (1978) who proved the Calabi
conjecture.
